# Call Of Gopher

## What it is

A RESTful API that recieves an input with the name, age, birthplace, residence and occupation of an investigator and responds with a complete character sheet in JSON form. 

It follows the rules for the 7nth edition of Chaosium's Call of Cthullu RPG.


## Todo 

The next step is to implement a frontend that is able to send the POST request to the backend as well as recuperate the JSON response and display it in a meaningful manner for the end user.
